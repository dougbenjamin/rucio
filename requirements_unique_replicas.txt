# Requirements for check_unique_replicas.py
#
# This script uses the Rucio client libraries from this repository.
# Install the Rucio client with:
#   pip install -e .
#
# Or install from PyPI:
#   pip install rucio-clients
#
# Note: This file lists the dependencies that are expected to be available
# when the Rucio client is properly installed.

# Core dependencies (included with Rucio client)

# Optional but recommended for better experience
# These are typically already installed with Python 3.6+
# and are part of the standard library

# For the tool itself (all standard library):
# - argparse (Python 3.2+)
# - json (Python 2.6+)
# - logging (Python 2.3+)
# - threading (Python 2.4+)
